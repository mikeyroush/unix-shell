# unix-shell

This project is a simple shell which implements a subset of Bash functionality. The following represents the shell's features and requirements:
- a continual prompt for user input
- a parser based on various tokens
- execution of well formed commands using fork and exec
  - this required the implementation of child processes
- support for input and output redirection to and from files
  - this required the manipulation of file descriptors
- allowance for users to run processes in the background using a '*&*'
- a custom prompt based on current directory, user name and current date/time


## Getting Started

These instructions will get you a copy of the project up and running on your local machine for testing purposes.

Download the zip then link the files in the command line via the makefile and run the executable

Navigate to the correct directory and utilize the makefile
